            I've been practicing Taekwondo since I was 7 years old and have earned a red belt. Taekwondo has taught me discipline, 
            respect, and self-control. The rigorous training has improved my flexibility, balance, and coordination. 
            Beyond the physical aspects, it has instilled in me a sense of perseverance and mental toughness.
          </p>
          <p class="skill-description">
            Through regular practice, I've mastered various kicks, blocks, and strikes. I've also participated in several 
            tournaments where I've had the opportunity to apply my skills and learn from other practitioners. The focus and 
            concentration required in Taekwondo has helped me in other areas of my life, including academics.

            Basketball is where I shine the most. As a point guard for my school team, I've developed strong ball-handling skills, 
            court vision, and shooting accuracy. Years of practice have honed my ability to make quick decisions under pressure 
            and adapt to different game situations.
          </p>
          <p class="skill-description">
            I'm particularly proud of my three-point shooting and defensive skills. Being smaller than some of my opponents has 
            pushed me to develop speed and agility to compensate. I practice dribbling drills daily and study professional games 
            to improve my understanding of strategies and techniques.
          </p>
          <p class="skill-description">
            Basketball has also taught me valuable leadership skills as I often help coordinate our team's offense and defense. 
            The teamwork aspect has shown me how to communicate effectively and trust my teammates, lessons that apply to many 
            areas of life.

            I discovered my interest in coding when I was 12, starting with simple HTML and CSS to create basic websites. Since then, 
            I've expanded my knowledge to include JavaScript, which allows me to add interactivity to web pages. I enjoy the 
            problem-solving aspect of programming and the satisfaction of seeing my code work as intended.
          </p>
          <p class="skill-description">
            Recently, I've been learning Python and exploring its applications in data analysis and automation. I've created several 
            small projects, including a personal blog, a basic calculator app, and a simple game. I'm fascinated by how coding allows 
            me to bring my ideas to life and create tools that can be useful to others.
          </p>
          <p class="skill-description">
            What I appreciate most about coding is that there's always something new to learn. The field is constantly evolving, which 
            keeps it challenging and exciting. I'm looking forward to continuing my coding journey and potentially pursuing it as a 
            career in the future.
